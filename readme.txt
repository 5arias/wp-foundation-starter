A starter theme called WP Foundation for Sites Starter.

== Description ==

WP Foundation for Sites Starter is a minimal Wordpress theme meant for hacking, so don't use this as a Parent Theme. Built with ZURB's Foundation for Sites and Automattic's `_s` starter theme, this theme provides a basic skeleton to get started building a Foundation 6 based theme. The complete F6 css is included, however most of the components are not implemented into the theme. I prefer to implement the components on as needed basis rather than spend time removing unused code.


== Installation ==

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the Add New button.
2. Click Upload and Choose File, then select the wp-foundation-starter.zip file. Click Install Now.
3. Click Activate to use your new theme right away.
